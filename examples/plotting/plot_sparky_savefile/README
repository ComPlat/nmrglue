plot_sparky_savefile example
==================

Introduction
------------

This example contains a Python script (plot_sparky.py), which plots a section of
an HSQC, which has been annotated using Sparky. The dataset used here is the 
15N-1H HSQC from BMRB Entry 6209.


Notes
-----

The raw data can be downloaded (BMRB Website)[http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/ftp/pub/bmrb/timedomain/bmr6209/timedomain_data/N15HSQC/].
You can process using Topspin/NMRglue/NMRPipe, and convert the processed data into .ucsf (Sparky) format.
The .ucsf file can then be assigned/annotated using an example shown (here)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzcJA-fEko0&t=109s].
The file should then be saved as a .save file in Sparky. The .save and .ucsf files are the inputs for plot_sparky.py
This particular image was generated using the following command:

python ./plot_sparky.py cam.save cam.ucsf bmrb_6209 8.55 7.0 123 116.4

Some adjustments will be needed to the text and cross marker size with different limits
